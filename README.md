Orion is a game engine I'm currently working on that sits ontop of the Monogame/XNA framework. 
Currently it only has support for 2D rendering. Some of the features include:  
* Tiling
* Entity Component System
* Camera
* Built in Physics
* Layer sorting
* State machines
* Inline Animation systems

#### Some of the stuff I'm working on:
* Particle engine
* User Interface
* Scene transitions
